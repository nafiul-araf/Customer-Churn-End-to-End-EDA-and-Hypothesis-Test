# Customer-Churn-End-to-End-EDA-and-Hypothesis-Test
This analysis offers valuable insights into factors influencing customer churn, highlighting actionable areas for enhancing retention.

## EDA Summary
In my exploratory data analysis, I examined various aspects of customer behavior and service preferences:
- **Churn rates** were analyzed across categories such as **contract types, payment methods, and service usage** (e.g., InternetService, StreamingTV).
- Key findings:
  - **Month-to-month contracts** and **Electronic check payment methods** were associated with higher churn rates.
  - Longer tenure generally correlated with lower churn rates.
- Segment analysis by **tenure ranges and monthly charges** helped identify at-risk customer groups, which can inform retention strategies.

## Hypothesis Testing Summary
For hypothesis testing, I aimed to validate the patterns observed in the EDA by statistically examining **churn relationships** with key variables:
- Using **Z-tests for proportions** and **ANOVA**, I confirmed:
  - **Churn rates were significantly higher** for month-to-month contracts compared to longer contracts.
  - **Electronic check users** exhibited a significantly higher churn rate than customers using other payment methods.
- These tests validated my initial insights, demonstrating that service-related factors play a crucial role in customer retention and can inform targeted interventions.
